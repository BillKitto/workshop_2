The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:  
He cannot choose but hear;  
And thus spake on that ancient man,  
The bright-eyed Mariner.  
  
'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,  
Merrily did we drop  
Below the kirk, below the hill,  
Below the lighthouse top.  
  
The Sun came up upon the left,   
Out of the sea came he!  
And he shone bright, and on the right  
Went down into the sea.  
  
Higher and higher every day,  
Till over the mast at noonâ€”'  
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,  
For he heard the loud bassoon.
